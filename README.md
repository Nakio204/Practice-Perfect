Hi, my name is Quan; you guys can call me Nakio. Nakio comes from Japanese (Akio - Bright). The 'N' in front of Akio is the last character in my name. 

The reason I created this repo is because I want to document my journey in the IT field and talk to myself about it. I must try a lot in the IT field. ðŸ”¥

I can do it, and you can do it too. Trust me. ðŸ˜Š
